# Asset Allocation
Scenario analysis and projections of different asset allocation schemes.

## scripts
### 2-asset.R
A simple two asset (equity/bond) allocation toggled through different allocations, rebalance thresholds and taxes.

### 3-asset.equal-wt.R
An equal weighted three asset (midcap/bond/nasdaq-100) allocation toggled through different rebalance thresholds and taxes.

### 3-asset.optimized.R
Uses portfolio optimization methods to allocate a three asset (midcap/bond/nasdaq-100) portfolio. The portfolio is then toggled through different rebalance thresholds and taxes. Variance (var) and expected tail loss (ETL) are minimized while mean returns are maximized.
