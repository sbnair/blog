# Mutual funds

## scripts
### alpha.beta.study.R
Some advisors use historical mutual fund performance metrics to suggest investment options to their clients. Is that the right thing to do? The script plots historical alpha, beta and information ratio of midcap mutual funds that have been around for at least a decade.

### mf.etf.discount.R
Plots the difference between the closing and last prices of ETFs with their corresponding mutual fund NAVs. It makes no sense to risk capital on thinly traded ETFs that trade wide off the mark!
